# my dot files
 - vim (neovim)
 - tmux
 - zsh

## updates
 > 16/08/17 finally purescript works well with my neovim :)

## todo
 - [x] add script to auto install and auto setup it in any linux/mac/windows environment
 - [x] add a good workflow for notetaking and todolist (get the best of org mode in vim)
    - ideas - using just vim notes and taskwarrior command line or my own todolist thingy
    - mostly should use vimwiki due to https://boddy.im/vim-dev-env.html "I can't recommend vimwiki enough: it is like an even-better org-mode ;-)"
 - [ ] get haskell working in the current neovim
 - [x] get fzf plugin in vim and  use it instead of ctrl-p
 - [ ] fix the tags for any general language, things should work well out of the box

## disclaimer
 - things are quite unstable
 - use at your own risk
 - do not use the install.sh script yet
