# my dot files
 - vim (neovim)
 - tmux
 - zsh

## updates
 > 16/08/17 finally purescript works well with my neovim :)

## todo
 - priority to solve ctrlp plugin with something faster, better and works in all general scenarios for me 
 - add script to auto install and auto setup it in any linux/mac/windows environment
 - add a good workflow for notetaking and todolist (get the best of org mode in vim)
    - ideas - using just vim notes and taskwarrior command line or my own todolist thingy
